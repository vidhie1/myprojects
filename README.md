images along with the cost labels placed below them, thus giving the feel of a real ecommerce 
website. Further, there is a slight top-to-bottom animation applied on the image when the the

Library Management System GUI (java)
The Library Management System project with GUI allows the 
user to input book details, such as book name, author name, ISBN, and category. 
These details are then added to a JTable that displays all the books in the library. 
The user can also delete or edit books from the table as required. 
When the user clicks on the "Add Book" button, the data entered in the form fields is 
added as a new row to the JTable. Similarly, when the user clicks on the "Delete Book" 
button, the selected rows from the JTable are deleted, and when the user clicks on the 
"Edit Book" button, the selected row in the JTable is edited with the new data entered in 
the form fields.
